# Architecture Spine: FestGrid

This document defines the core architectural invariants for the FestGrid application. These decisions are binding for all development to ensure consistency and coherence across the platform.

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-1: Unified Query DSL

*   **Binds:** All filtering and query operations for events across the application, including the discovery page, subscribed account page, and push notification filtering.
*   **Prevents:** The development of separate or incompatible query mechanisms for different features.
*   **Rule:** All event queries sent from a client to the backend will conform to a unified JSON-based Domain Specific Language (DSL). This DSL has a recursive structure to allow for complex, nested queries.

    **Structure:**
    The core of the DSL is a JSON object with two keys:
    *   `operator`: (`"and"` | `"or"`) - Defines how the conditions should be combined.
    *   `conditions`: An array of one or more condition objects.

    A condition object can be either:
    1.  A nested query object, containing its own `operator` and `conditions`.
    2.  A terminal condition object with the structure:
        *   `field`: The name of the field to query (e.g., `"eventName"`, `"category"`).
        *   `operator`: The comparison operator (e.g., `"contains"`, `"in"`).
        *   `value`: The value to compare against.

    **Example:**
    This example finds events where the name contains "Festival" AND (the category is "MUSIC" OR the location is near the user's "Home").

    ```json
    {
      "operator": "and",
      "conditions": [
        { "field": "eventName", "operator": "contains", "value": "Festival" },
        {
          "operator": "or",
          "conditions": [
            { "field": "category", "operator": "in", "value": ["MUSIC"] },
            { "field": "locationPreferenceId", "operator": "in", "value": ["uuid-for-home"] }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    **Fields and Operators:**
    A formal list of queryable fields and the operators that apply to them will be maintained in the API documentation. This includes:
    *   **string:** `contains`, `equals`, `notEquals`
    *   **enum (type, category):** `in`, `notIn`
    *   **ID (locationPreferenceId, socialMediaAccountProfileId):** `in`, `notIn`

### AD-2: Unified Event Querying

*   **Binds:** The retrieval of all event collections, including the main discovery page, the user's "Favorite Events" page, and the "Added to Calendar" page.
*   **Prevents:** The creation of specialized, single-purpose API endpoints for fetching different collections of events (e.g., `/api/favorites`, `/api/added-events`).
*   **Rule:** All event collections must be retrieved through the primary event query endpoint using the `Unified Query DSL` (AD-1). Specific collections will be requested by adding the appropriate conditions to the query.

    **Example (fetching favorited events):**
    ```json
    {
      "operator": "and",
      "conditions": [
        { "field": "isFavorited", "operator": "equals", "value": true }
      ]
    }
    ```
